      <p1>1.<b>QE High School: </b> 
        Queen Elizabeth High School in Edmonton offers sports, music, and clubs to help students grow. These activities improve teamwork, leadership, and time management skills, making students stronger in school and life.</p1>
      <p2>2.<b>Music Player UI</b>
        This music player user interface is a basic design for creating a simple and easy-to-use music app. It includes an album artwork space, song title, artist name, progress bar, playback buttons (shuffle, previous, play/pause, next, repeat), a favorite button, and a waveform display. These features help users control their music smoothly while keeping the design clear and engaging. A well-designed user interface makes the app more interactive, enjoyable, and adaptable for different devices like phones, websites, or computers.</p2>

      <p>3. <b>Jey Uso’s “Main Event Ish”</b> theme combines tribal beats and hip-hop, showing his Samoan roots and strong persona. It creates excitement for his entrance.

        For a music player, it's important because the track has powerful beats and vocals that need to be clear. The player must have good sound quality, volume control, and smooth playback to enhance the listening experience.
