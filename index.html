      <p>This music player user interface is a basic design for creating a simple and easy-to-use music app. It includes an album artwork space, song title, artist name, progress bar, playback buttons (shuffle, previous, play/pause, next, repeat), a favorite button, and a waveform display. These features help users control their music smoothly while keeping the design clear and engaging. A well-designed user interface makes the app more interactive, enjoyable, and adaptable for different devices like phones, websites, or computers.</p>
      <p>The video shows The Rock vs. Erick Rowan at WrestleMania 32, where The Rock wins in just six seconds with a Rock Bottom, setting a record for the fastest match. John Cena then returns to help him fight off The Wyatt Family, making it an exciting moment.    <b>Importance for Building Music:</b>
      Just like WWE hypes up a match with music and timing, a good music player should create excitement and keep users engaged with smooth controls and a great listening experience.</p>
